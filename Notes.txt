    5. Style the application using the provided CSS variables and styles.
    6. Open terminal and run the following commands:
        - npm install (to install dependencies)
        - npm run dev (to start development server)
        - npm run build (to create production build)
        - npm start (to run production server)

Success! Created website-project at C:\Fra_Asus_til_MSI\VS-Code\website-project\website-project
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

Initially shows only the service title
On hover:
Card slightly lifts up
Background color changes

Using opacity and transform for smooth transitions
Would you like me to:
Adjust the animation timing?
Modify the hover effect style?
Change the layout or spacing?
Add different hover animations?



The development workflow is:
Make changes to files
Test with npm start
Repeat steps 1-2 until you're happy with the results
Create production build with npm run build
Serve production build with serve -s build
Would you like to test the changes in development mode first?
